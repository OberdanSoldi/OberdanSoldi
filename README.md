## Hello there! 

My name is Oberdan and I'm currently learning to program. ðŸ’»


Talking about Personal Stuff:
- :octocat: My current areas of interest are web development. 
- :book: Iâ€™m currently learning the following languages: CSS, HTML, JavaScript and PostgreSQL.

##
*NOTE: Top languages does not indicate my skill level or something like that, it's a github metric of which languages i have the most code on github, it's a new feature of [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)*
